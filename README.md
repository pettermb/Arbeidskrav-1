# Arbeidskrav-1 
This is a repository for an assignment in the subject IDR4000, as part of the master program in excercise physiology. 
We recruited 8 people (1 withdraw due to sickness) to do a squat jump test and a cycling test twice on separate days. 
The purpose of this study was to determine the reliability of the test, and practise our skills in conducting laboratory testing. 
This repository is used for r scripts which will lead to a text where we represent the results.
